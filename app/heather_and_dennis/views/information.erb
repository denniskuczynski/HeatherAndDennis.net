<h3>The Venue</h3>
<p>
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Michaels,_Maryland">St. Michael's, Maryland</a><br/>
  St. Michaels is located on Marylandâ€™s Eastern Shore. The historic town dates back to the mid-1600s when it served as a trading post for area tobacco farmers and trappers. 
</p>

<p>
  It is known as "The Town that Fooled the British" because of a legend about a clever defense strategy during the War of 1812. The people of St. Michaels hung their lanterns in treetops, and when the British invaded, they were fooled into thinking the town was farther away than it really was. Consequently the British cannons "overshot" the town.
